HAG_Doc1_Frozen2,"Parents, you can breathe a sigh of relief. Frozen 2’s new showstopper “Into the Unknown” isn’t as aggressive an earworm as “Let it Go”. It’s more lyrically complex, with a lot more high notes – the kind that’ll break your eardrums if sung by anyone who isn’t Idina Menzel – and it’s hard to imagine a car full of kids howling such a delicate scale for hours upon hours.
Frozen 2, Disney’s sequel to its $1.3bn hit, is more mature, ambitious, and intricate than its predecessor. That doesn’t automatically make it better – Frozen’s success was built on a simple and relatable story of sisterly love – but it’s different enough not to feel like a stale rerun. There are surprises here to uncover, and a renewed sense of energy to the proceedings. Admittedly, the film does play with fire by taking the same path as other sequels, padding out a character’s backstory in the hope it’ll add depth to their world. There are echoes of last month’s Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, as Queen Elsa (Menzel) is carted off to a magical place that might provide a few answers about where she comes from. But Frozen 2 succeeds where so many others have failed.
As the sentient snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) himself neatly summarises in one scene, Elsa made peace with her ice powers at the end of Frozen, when she discovered that the key to it all was love. Now, she rules over Arendelle, while Anna (Kristen Bell) and her boyfriend Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) provide a sense of domestic normalcy through weekly charade sessions.
That is, until a mysterious female voice (provided by Norwegian singer Aurora) pierces the quiet and shakes Elsa’s soul. Is someone out there looking for her? Does she have a greater purpose beyond the castle walls? Anyone hoping Disney is finally giving Elsa a girlfriend, by the way, will be sorely disappointed – her sexuality still remains purposefully obscure.
Instead, this alluring call draws Elsa into an enchanted forest that feels ripped straight from the pages of Norwegian mythology. There are giants, runes, and an indigenous tribe inspired by the Sámi people. Frozen 2 has an authenticity that immediately separates it from so many other subpar follow-ups. Its worldbuilding not only feels earned, but meaningful. Returning directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck ensure that every frame is exquisitely detailed and rich with colour: we move gracefully from autumn leaves to the pinkish glow of ethereal fire, then on to stormy, grey waves and shimmering ice crystals.
Certain sequences here are even more spectacular than the creation of Elsa’s ice castle, with the filmmakers now more confident to step out of reality and deliver something truly jaw-dropping. Lee’s screenplay, too, makes some bold choices. She teases out several compelling ideas: environmentalism, reparations, exploitation and how we should confront the past. It’s all vague enough that it could be applied to a hundred different real-world situations, which perhaps makes it all the more powerful as a learning tool for families.
But Frozen 2 doesn’t lose itself in rootless ambition. It works because we’re guided through these strange, unfamiliar surroundings by the steady hands of Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf – characters with whom we’re all very much familiar (or, for some parents, exhaustingly familiar) – and the cast sink straight back into their roles."
HAG_Doc2_Frozen2,"They’re back – the first Disney princesses to persuade the box-office that they don’t need a handsome prince to extract them from trouble.
Instead, they rely on sisterly love and co-operation, and it’s working. Frozen II is already shaping up as the most lucrative animated movie ever made.
It opens as Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) is settling into her routine as queen of Arendelle, her Nordic realm precariously perched on the edge of a fjord. She is satisfied that she has learnt to control the magical gift that has endowed her with the powers of a human ice-making machine and life is looking good. But something is bothering her. The neighbouring forest is enchanted which, in this case, is bad news for it’s been turned into a no-go zone by a blinding mist so thick that its indigenous residents, the Northuldra, can’t get out and everybody else is barred from getting in. It’s a stalemate and Elsa is beginning to believe that she can bring it to an end.
The film is directed by the same team who did the original and once again, they have arrived at a judicious mixture of old and new. The action is punctuated with enough songs to fill an MGM musical and although the animation is computer-generated in 3D, its style owes a lot to the glory days of the studio’s hand-drawn animation era and its traditional Disney princesses with their wide eyes and doll-like faces. The script, however, is scrupulously up-to-date with great attention paid to the films’ feminist credentials and cultural correctness. After the writers decided to tap into Nordic folklore, Scandinavia’s Sami communities were consulted and the background artists, we’re told, were equally scrupulous, composing a landscape without a plant out of place.
It turns out that the forest has gone into lockdown because of environmental damage sustained years earlier. Naturally, human beings were responsible and Elsa and her sister, Anna (Kristen Bell) suspect that the secret is buried in their own family’s history. But they can discover the truth only by risking a trip into the forest.
The expedition takes a while to get underway. First, their intentions and fears have to be spelled out in song and their escorts – Olaf, the warm-hearted snowman (Josh Gad), Anna’s suitor Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his reindeer, Sven – have to be briefed.
And when they get there and set about putting things to rights, the script isn’t exactly adroit in dreaming up obstacles to impede their progress. Its contrivances are decidedly creaky, the aim being to separate the group of friends so that they become small islands of desperation, each convinced that the others have left them to fend for themselves. The exception is Elsa, who charges off on her own quest, fighting fire, flood and cyclone by shooting out mini-ice floes at every turn. It’s impressive enough to suggest that she should be called upon to help in quenching the Californian –or our own – bushfires.
Anna and Kristoff lose one another amid the mayhem but she, at least, has Olaf to provide comic relief, which becomes essential when they become trapped in a maze-like cavern deep in the forest’s forbidding basalt escarpment. The Arendelle scenes are a study in autumnal colours but once we reach the forest, the film’s palette takes a sudden turn to the dark and wintry.
The climax gives both sisters the chance to be heroes but the most spectacular bits belong to Elsa and her encounters with the Dark Sea, home of the Nokk – an equine water spirit–who doesn’t exactly welcome her into his domain. These sequences have a gleam and a rhythm to them that encapsulates Disney animation at its purest and most sinuous.
The film itself doesn’t hit that sweet spot that makes Pixar animations, for example, fun for adults as well as their children. Its pace is uneven and in the early scenes, the songs slow down the action so much that the younger kids at my screening were getting restless. But judging from those US box-office figures, there’s more than enough here to build on the goodwill generated by the original and create a besotted new audience."
HAG_Doc3_Frozen2,"Released in 2013 to a record-scorching $1.29 billion, “Frozen” was such a huge hit for Walt Disney Animation Studios that many of its fans were probably assuming its sequel would play it safe and deliver more of the same: a sparkling 21st-century fairy tale in which a pair of wide-eyed heroines shrug off the need to be rescued by men, demonstrating the power of self-reliance and sisterly love. Certainly, screenwriter Jennifer Lee (who once again co-directs with Chris Buck) would be foolish to stray too far from this formula, but “Frozen II” is anything but a mindless remake.
Ironically, “Frozen” fans may secretly be wishing for a more straightforward rehash, and to them, the best advice comes in the form of three little words: “Let it go” — a mantra they’ve surely internalized since the first movie. As with snowflakes, no two are alike, and this gorgeous, glittering reunion of siblings Anna (Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel) proudly flaunts its own identity, even while taking care to incorporate so much of what worked about the original — like a steady stream of wisecracks from wonderstruck snowperson Olaf (Josh Gad).
In myriad ways, “Frozen II” feels more like a follow-up to Pixar’s “Brave” than it does an extension of Disney’s earlier (very loose) adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Snow Queen.” Gone is the need for a conventional villain; gone are any expectations of princes charming or otherwise; gone are the gowns that have shaped young women’s dreams of prom and wedding attire for more than a century. “Frozen II” pushes the girl-power themes even further, rejecting dresses in favor of pants for much of the adventure, as Anna and Elsa set out to find the source of a mysterious song emanating from somewhere far to the north — a mythical place called Ahtohallan that holds the secret of their parents’ disappearance, as well as the key to finding peace with nature and the Northuldra, an indigenous tribe toward whom they’ve been taught to be wary.
“Frozen II” isn’t obnoxious about its revisionist point of view — progressive vis-à-vis the Disney values of past decades — though it’s hardly subtle about its millennial-minded politics either. The film opens with a bedtime-story version of the kingdom’s past — as recounted by the royal sisters’ parents, king Agnarr (Alfred Molina) and queen Iduna (Evan Rachel Wood) of Arendelle — in which their grandfather (Jeremy Sisto) and head general Mattias (Sterling K. Brown) are portrayed as the victims of a magical attack that resulted in an enchanted forest being wrapped in mist for more than 34 years. This prologue ends with the revelation (too obvious to be considered a spoiler) that Granddad was actually a conniving colonialist, and that everything bad that has happened to the family was a direct result of his misguided attempts to manipulate others.
Such themes surely resonate with today’s younger audiences, who, when confronted with issues such as racial inequity and climate change, are being forced to reckon with the sins and shortcomings of previous generations. The words of environmental activist Greta Thunberg’s recent speech echo in Anna and Elsa’s actions: “You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal.”
Conventional Disney princess movies — in which alabaster beauties from Snow White to Belle passively awaited the liberating effects of true love’s kiss — may have been taken at face value for most of the studio’s history, but today’s kids have gotten savvy. They recognize the often-problematic socializing effects of popular entertainment, and they demand better. They also know when they’re being patronized, and at times, “Frozen II” tiptoes a bit too carefully along that fine line, where escapism stops being fun because the adults responsible have started overthinking the politics of it all.
The first half-hour smacks of calculation, as the movie finds ways to message to audiences where it stands in relation to the original, rather than intuitively picking up where that installment left off, the way the “Toy Story” and “How to Train Your Dragon” sequels so gracefully did. In a way, songwriting couple Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez set this challenge for themselves by creating such a memorable Broadway-style soundtrack for the first movie, and here, the first couple songs (including the forgettable “All Is Found”) feel second best.
It’s not until Menzel sings “Into the Unknown” that “Frozen II” comes anywhere near the goose-bump-inducing, icicles-on-the-nape-of-your-neck thrill audiences experienced with “Let It Go” last time around — although none of this cartoon’s new tunes packs quite that punch. Even so, the characters spend an awful lot of time singing: Groff delivers the amusingly over-earnest pop-idol parody “Lost in the Woods,” and later, Bell belts out goody-goody anthem “The Next Right Thing.” (All three of those songs are repeated in less-interesting Radio Disney-ready cover versions over the marathon end-credits roll, performed by the likes of Panic! at the Disco, Kacey Musgraves and Weezer.)
In a Broadway show, the musical numbers reveal feelings the characters wouldn’t dare speak aloud, although the most effective “I want” song here comes from none other than Olaf, who yearns to understand the world better “When I Am Older.” All four characters alternate articulating where their minds are at the opening via the song “Some Things Never Change,” and though the sequence features stunning animation, its presence stalls the proceedings. Whereas the prologue informs that “the fighting enraged the spirits, and they turned against us” — language clearly engineered to misdirect — it’s not until nearly an hour later, when the trolls explain, “The past is not what it seems. … The truth must be found,” that the story finally finds its proper course.
Reunited by their last adventure, the sisters are now closer than ever. Though Elsa has been named queen, she privately wrestles with the feeling that she doesn’t belong in Arendelle. She’s been gifted with magical abilities — namely, the blessing/curse of blasting snow and ice from her fingertips — and yet, the first movie never explained how or why she came by these talents, while Anna lacks them altogether. “Frozen II” gives Elsa a chance to get to the bottom of the mystery while showing audiences that it’s OK for people to feel restless when their potential is being constrained. Normally, a character in Elsa’s position would wander off on her own in search of answers, but her connection with Anna is too strong for that, and her sister insists on coming along. As Anna tells her at one point, “You don’t want me to follow you into fire? Then don’t run into fire!”
Clearly, familial love still takes precedence over the romantic kind this time around. While Anna focuses on accompanying Elsa to the enchanted forest, her would-be suitor Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) is trying to psych himself into proposing marriage, but every time he opens his mouth in Anna’s company, he winds up choking on his own foot instead. The movie isn’t necessarily against matrimony, but it doesn’t want girls to think it’s the secret to living happily ever after either, offering a variation on the way fairy tales and Jane Austen novels have sold the institution to female audiences in the past.
Confiding in his ever-reliable reindeer Sven, Kristoff struggles with showing Anna his true feelings for most of the movie, before at last making himself useful with the words “I’m here. What do you need?” How wonderful it would be to see that simple phrase adopted by the problem-solving men of Western society — it may well be the most welcome lesson the movie has to offer: Anna doesn’t need rescuing in “Frozen II,” but she could use support, and rather than barging in and taking control, Kristoff respects her enough to pitch in with whatever plan she has in motion.
The visuals, imbued with an iridescent lavender-glow color palette throughout, are lovely but never overwhelming. That’s important, since computer-generated movies are capable of appearing so much better than their live-action counterparts that they sometimes fall into the trap of distracting us with the way they look. (“The Lion King,” for instance, exploited a magic-hour-all-the-time aesthetic that makes that elusive sheen seem less special.)
What Disney hasn’t quite solved is its digitally rendered character designs, subtly altered from the earlier movie but still more akin to computer-generated Bratz dolls — with their big eyes, bobble heads and pink plastic skin — than to appealing hand-drawn humans. As a sequel, “Frozen II” is locked into the look of the earlier film, whereas “Moana” took a step in the right direction, finding a three-dimensional equivalent for the studio’s classical animated characters. Maybe that’s a question of generational taste, as younger audiences plainly see themselves in Anna and Elsa, in both style and spirit. How fitting then, that writer-director Lee’s script reflects a more modernized set of values. In a world where old-timers accuse the youth of being oversensitive snowflakes, “Frozen II” shows what it means to have one’s heart in the right place."
HAG_Doc4_Frozen2,"After the colossal success of Frozen, Disney’s 2013 princess blockbuster to end all blockbusters, audiences should be well aware of the mythic kingdom of Arendelle. In this haven among the icy fjords, Queen Elsa (played by Idina Menzel) and her sister, Anna (Kristen Bell), have lived in peace since completing their last adventure, which revolved around Elsa’s magical powers and Anna’s poor taste in visiting princes. But hark! As Frozen II begins, Elsa starts hearing a strange noise from the north, echoing out of an enchanted forest enveloped in fog. What could lie beyond those mists? Why, it’s the siren song of sequel money!
Though Disney has never been averse to revisiting a story for profit, continuations of its cartoon features used to be direct-to-video. Frozen II is, in fact, the company’s first-ever theatrical sequel to an animated princess film, so it has a high bar to clear simply to justify its existence. Previous follow-ups were capers like The Rescuers Down Under and Ralph Breaks the Internet; as another Disney project recently proved, it’s difficult to write new chapters for fairy tales with definitive endings. But Frozen was such an unprecedented smash that these omens were ignored, sending Elsa and Anna (and the directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck) into the enchanted forest’s mystical haze.
The result is a convoluted, sporadically sensical, occasionally trippy film that can’t quite find a purpose amid all the manic world-building. Frozen II will make plenty of money and surely satisfy the younger audiences it’s mostly aimed at, but even as someone who enjoyed the ’90s-musical throwback of the first Frozen, I found little to relish this time around. Yes, it has the brassy ballads and sparkly one-liners that helped define the “Disney Renaissance” style to which Frozen paid homage. But the sequel doesn’t build on what made the first movie so agreeable.
For one thing, the original film’s central theme—the power of sisterly bonds—is repeated in Frozen II with minimal variation. Elsa, now confident in exploring the outer limits of her ice sorcery, is once again tempted to leave her kingdom and face danger on her own, while Anna, who is less magical but more sensible and social, tries to rein her in. The narrative arc of the sisters’ journey north is buried in whole snowdrifts of backstory about the past colonial sins of Anna and Elsa’s frosty kingdom.
It would be heartening to see this film grapple with the simplistic feudal politics of so many Disney classics, if the script could do so coherently. But Frozen II is too beholden to formula to dig deep. After all, it has to devote a chunk of time to Olaf (Josh Gad), the wisecracking snowman bumbling alongside our heroes, who’s designed to earn laughs from the kids but deserves only eye rolls from anyone else. There are also further efforts to delve into Elsa’s supernatural background, embellishing a story arc that already felt complete.
As in the original, the songs were composed by Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, who also contributed to the music of Coco. But there’s nothing here on the level of the team’s Oscar winners, “Let It Go” and “Remember Me.” The biggest banger of Frozen II is “Into the Unknown,” a honking solo from Elsa about the lure of the great beyond, which features the requisite number of soaring key changes from Menzel. Still, it doesn’t quite have that magic Disney mix of earworm melody and thematically resonant lyrics; given how early in the film it comes, it almost feels like Elsa is vainly trying to sell the audience on the story’s relevance.
The song I most enjoyed was a rather ridiculous power ballad titled “Lost in the Woods,” sung by Anna’s moose-riding boyfriend, Kristoff (Jonathan Groff). Despite his proven Broadway talent, Groff was robbed of a proper song in the first Frozen. The sequel makes up for that by giving him something straight out of the Jim Steinman songbook: a forlorn mountaineer ditty that is presented with every music-video cliché in the book. This campy fun, along with Kristoff’s chummy reliability, helps to lighten up a plot that’s otherwise weighed down by elaborate exposition.
Frozen II sometimes gets impressionistic enough to reach the heights of its forebear, which was at its best when Elsa cut loose and made towering ice sculptures to symbolize her loneliness. A couple of sequences see the queen skiing across a raging ocean, encountering water spirits in the shape of horses, and exploring caverns of crystalline memories. Those standout moments, reliant on music and visuals, hit harder than the bulk of the dialogue. Most of the time, though, this elaborate plot doesn’t yield anything remotely original. Frozen II may be big and expensive-looking, but it has no more reason to exist than the direct-to-DVD offerings Disney used to churn out."
HAG_Doc5_Frozen2,"Animated adventure featuring the voices of Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, Josh Gad, Jonathan Groff, Sterling K. Brown, Evan Rachel Wood, Alfred Molina and Martha Plimpton. Written by Jennifer Lee, Chris Buck, Marc E. Smith, Kristen Anderson- Lopez and Robert Lopez. Directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee. Opens Nov. 21 at theatres. everywhere. 104 minutes. PG
The show-stopping tune of Disney’s “Frozen 2” is titled “The Next Right Thing,” which could also serve as the subtitle and guiding philosophy of this sequel to the 2013 animated blockbuster.
“Frozen” hit the jackpot. Its story of sisters Elsa (Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell) fighting to save their Nordic realm of Arendelle from perpetual chill struck a chord with moviegoers, aided by a catchy soundtrack that included the Oscar-winning ballad, “Let It Go.”
Six years later, the magic remains and the gang’s all here (again), but as with almost every sequel ever made, the followup fails to top the original. It’s indeed “The Next Right Thing,” in the sense of being second best, but it’s still the right thing to see for families seeking fun and adventure at the movie theatre.
“Frozen” directors/co-writers Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee return at the helm and the pen, with composer Christophe Beck contributing another resonant score.
Songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez are back with a brace of new tunes that, if not quite the equal of the original soundtrack, still include such hummable ditties as “The Next Right Thing,” “Into the Unknown” and “Some Things Never Change,” plus the wistful ballad “When I Am Older.”
The latter is sung by comedic snowman Olaf, voiced by Josh Gad, who is a much greater presence in this film. If you found yourself wishing more of the goofy snow person from the first picture, you’re in luck.
Joining Olaf for anthropomorphic sidekick antics is reindeer Sven, who acts as mute love adviser to mountain man Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), who is working up his nerve to ask Anna to marry him.
The story, co-written by many hands, is at once the same — Elsa and Anna have to team save Arendelle again, along with their extended family — while also being more complicated.
The mythology and backstory, which includes amusing callbacks to “Frozen” and serious resonance with real-world concerns about the environment and personal identity, recall not only the original inspiration — Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale “The Snow Queen” — but also “The Lord of the Rings” and “Game of Thrones.”
One thing that really sets “Frozen 2” apart from its predecessor is the visuals, which are as gorgeous and awe-inspiring as computer animation can possibly get. Movie tech has really advanced in the past six years.
The cold wind that threatens to engulf Elsa, as she sallies forth to discover the source of a distant voice only she can hear, is as palpable as an early November storm through a summer jacket.
The film also has some of the most colourful autumn scenes of recent movie memory along with inventive uses for running water, which may not be what you’d expect from a film so dedicated to winter and ice.
It just goes to show you there’s still the warmth of creativity within the colourful snow palace that is “Frozen 2.”"
HAG_Doc6_Frozen2,"Three weeks after Donald Trump was elected president I went to see Disney’s Moana. It made me smile for the first time since the election and cry for the hundredth. A few months later, I came out as trans and the movie’s power ballad, “How Far I’ll Go” became my private little trans anthem. There was something about the simplicity of a Disney “I want” song that captured my intense feelings.
But the voice inside sings a different song/What is wrong with me?
I’m certainly not the first queer person to project their coming out onto a Disney musical. Some people watched Pinocchio and wished to be a real boy. Others watched The Little Mermaid and longed to be part of that world. Many, many watched Mulan and wondered when their reflection would show who they were inside.
But none of these movies, not Moana, not even Mulan, elicited the same queer uproar as Frozen. By 2013, the possibility of a gay Disney movie didn’t feel as far-fetched as it might have ten years prior. Mainstream LGBTQ+ acceptance was moving at a rapid pace, at least when it came to palatable queerness, and what was more palatable than a white cis femme snow queen?
While certainly unintended by its straight co-directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, and its straight co-songwriters Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, Frozen works remarkably well as a queer allegory. Its power is not simply that Elsa reads as queer. It’s the specificity of her queerness, and her struggles with that queerness, that really make it sing.
Don’t let them in, don’t let them see/Be the good girl you always have to be
Frozen is not about Elsa falling in love with another woman. And it’s not just about her feeling different and learning to accept that difference. What Frozen is really about is the guilt queer people feel when coming out – the feeling that being ourselves will hurt the ones we love most. Elsa and her sister Anna make me think about my own family members that told me again and again how hard my coming out was on them. When I watch the sisters hug at the end of the movie I feel a possibility for healing – the stuff of fairy tales, but comforting all the same.
I didn’t expect Frozen 2 to give Elsa a girlfriend, despite the widespread internet campaign. I was far more worried that the perfect allegory of the first film would be ruined with the opposite. I was worried they’d give her a boyfriend. Thankfully the sequel did not make that misstep, but it makes another that’s more complicated, and, in its own way, equally painful. It doesn’t erase the magic of its predecessor, but it strips itself of its own potential.
If Disney wasn’t ready to explicitly represent a fifth of its young audience, they could’ve at least given Elsa a gal pal. I don’t need to see Elsa make out with the mysterious voice calling her to the next chapter of queer life, but lord did it have to be her mother?
The plot of the sequel is both convoluted and familiar. Elsa is feeling another swirling storm inside and unleashes the power of the nearby enchanted forest. It was closed for decades – ever since her father narrowly escaped as a teen after a mysterious disaster. With the magic forces freed, Arendelle has become unlivable, and Elsa, along with Anna, her boyfriend Kristoff, his reindeer Sven, and their snowman Olaf, must venture into the mystery. Elsa must follow the voice.
Are you someone out there who’s a bit like me?/Who knows deep down I’m not where I’m meant to be?
The enchanted forest allows for some truly stunning animation, and the introduction of creatures that I’m sure have already been turned into toys. But the emotional beats of the forest often feel hollow. Anna’s insistence on following her sister lacks the motivation of the original film, instead reading as a foolish death wish. She knows she lacks Elsa’s powers, so why doesn’t she realize her presence is simply a burden? Allegorically, why is Anna trying to tag along with her sister to the gay bar?
But, of course, this isn’t the allegory at play. When Elsa finally does discover the voice, it’s not a coded lover – someone a bit like her – but instead the spirit of her mother. This is made especially painful by the incredibly gay lyrics in her dead mom duet.
Are you the one I’ve been looking for/All my life?
Elsa’s mother reveals why she’s been calling her daughter to this land – and reveals the actual allegory. The inhabitants of the forest are coded as Indigenous and Arendelle was responsible for the destruction of their land. Elsa’s mother reveals that she was one of these Indigenous people but she rescued Elsa’s father out of love. There’s a moment where it seems like the movie might be making an interesting point about reckoning with a colonial past, but then Elsa finds a way to save the forest and Arendelle, and any strength in the metaphor is removed. A statue is erected to commemorate their parents’ love, a painfully reductive celebration of people coming together. The film’s take on colonialism ends up being as morally complex as Disney’s Pocahontas. Ultimately, this becomes the film’s most abhorrent misstep, beyond its disappointing approach to queerness.
What made Frozen special as a queer allegory is it didn’t require a double consciousness. Unlike other very-gay-not-gay movies, there are no scenes in Frozen that have to be ignored; no moment where Elsa is forced to engage in compulsory heterosexuality. You can enjoy the movie from beginning to end with your whole gay heart. But Frozen 2 does not allow that. Instead you have to parse through the complicated mess that is Elsa having queer longings for her mother.
This isn’t to say Frozen 2 is without its pleasures. The soundtrack really is phenomenal, as is the animation. The world that’s built is a joy to watch and the script is filled with a lot of fun humor. The movie also contains a thread of environmentalism that works much better than its attempts at portraying colonization. But despite these strengths, the movie just made me feel sad. When Kristoff proposes to Anna near the end of the film, I felt its message deep within me: queer children still don’t get a love story.
Maybe someday we’ll finally see the movie we deserve – a queer Disney musical that loves us back. But until then I’ll listen to the Frozen 2 soundtrack and imagine it was supported by a movie with even a single snowflake of moral courage."
HAG_Doc7_Frozen2,"We have seen it thousands of times in our lives but it has never felt more menacing than it does now. 
I am speaking of the digital version of the Disney logo, in which the camera swoops down from Cinderella’s castle, roaming over river and dale like a hungry vulture. It runs before the start of Frozen 2, the forthcoming box office behemoth that will be holding the company’s water until the next one—Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker—debuts in a month.
What for much of our lives felt like an invitation to magical wonder, in the days following the Disney+ takeover of our streaming habits, registers more like a declaration of lands conquered as well as something of an implied threat. The House of Mouse has long controlled our childhoods, our imaginations, our imaginations of childhood, and our debit cards. What could possibly be next?  
After spending most of its existence convincing young women that someday their prince will come, Disney made an off-brand yet largely successful play for women’s empowerment with 2013‘s Frozen. With that film’s inevitable sequel, the filmmakers—returning directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, working from a script by Lee, who also serves as the Chief Creative Officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios—seem less interested in the easily meme-able and hummable girl power that made the first film so meaningful for so many. 
Instead, they have chosen to commit themselves to a rather complicated if not particularly memorable story that revolves around the sins of the lead characters’ grandparents. The overstuffed tale, structured Tolkien-like as a perilous quest by a party of adventurers, involves a 35-year-old infrastructure project, an enchanted forest sealed off from the rest of the world by an impenetrable fog, and a mysterious voice that keeps the headstrong ice queen Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) perpetually distracted as if she’s getting texts throughout the whole movie. 
Both the songs (once again written by two-time Oscar-winners Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez) and the relationships between the characters—strong points of the original film—register with less energy and originality this time around.
Yes, the most dynamic pairing is the sisters; unfortunately, all the energy flows entirely in one direction. Anna (Kristen Bell) is obsessed with the well-being of Elsa, whose mind is on the more pressing matter of calming the nature spirits threatening to lay waste to Arendelle. The problem is so pronounced that Anna is unable to notice the absolute devotion expressed towards her by Kristoff (Jonathan Groff). Anna’s dedication towards her sister is less admirable than it is an adult manifestation of childhood trauma that is keeping her from moving forward; it requires less a splashy song than some serious time on the therapist’s couch.
The silken-voiced Groff gets a sensitive power ballad in “Lost in the Wood,” a sequence presented in the style of an early ’90s hair band video. This meta joke, more fitting in style with the humor of Dreamworks Animation movies, played gangbusters in the crowded movie theater where I saw the film, though it was hard to tell if at least some of the cheesiness people were laughing at in the cliché-ridden song was unintentional. Mendel, one of the defining Broadway voices of our time, shows the ability to go from throat-lozenge slick to fire hose powerful with barely an upshift, letting it go to great effect with “Into the Great Unknown.”
The problem is that, while the visuals sometimes have stunning beauty and motion, there is little on screen or in the soundtrack that feels truly unknown, or carries any of the freshness of the snow that covers Elsa’s kingdom. That’s not to say that there aren’t a few surprises: Josh Gad’s Olaf is emotionally adroit and full of fast changes and unexpected beats. Gad, who adds comic spark to the otherwise pedestrian “When I Am Older,” has helped give life to a character whose steadfastness and open-hearted vulnerability has made him a worthy comedy successor to Burt Lahr’s Cowardly Lion.
It’s just that the world that surrounds the sentient snowman feels all too familiar, and the ideas expressed in the film are intended to fulfill built-in expectations rather than challenge us or buck long-held princess film conventions the way the first movie did so memorably. As a result, Frozen 2 has no special message to impart beyond the obvious: it’s Disney’s woods—and we’re just lost in them."
HAG_Doc8_Frozen2,"Two thoughts occurred while watching the sequel to Frozen. First: Man, the field of computer animation has come a long way when it comes to depicting water. Every drop of H2O here – and there is a lot of it, in the form of rippling and then rushing rivers, towering tidal waves, pelting rain, and all the chilled equivalents – looks exactly like the aqua of our world. However much money was deemed necessary to spend on perfecting the art of animating water to such photorealistic perfection, it was well-budgeted and spent. I could watch the background environmental action here for hours. But then the second thought of my Frozen 2 experience hit: I really wish I was listening to Let it Go right now.
For all the many millions of dollars thrown at Frozen 2?s next-generation computer animation, and the many millions more devoted to the film’s various artisans and voice performers and musicians, the new film simply doesn’t sing. Not, at least, like its predecessor, which arrived in 2013 as a curiosity if not outright annoyance (a non-Pixar Disney film? Pfffft) and left that same year as a cultural typhoon wherein not one inch of the culture was safe from domination. Whatever cinematic alchemy enriched the original Frozen to such delirious heights – from the playful animation to Idina Menzel’s to-the-rafters rendition of Let it Go – has been since crystallized in time, never to be thawed. So returning co-directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck make do with what, only a decade ago, might be considered decent enough material to warrant a direct-to-video sequel à la The Lion King 1 1/2 or Aladdin 2: The Return of Jaffar.
The new film opens three years after the events of the first, with the superpowered Elsa (Menzel) happily if warily ruling over the wintry kingdom of Arendelle, her loyal sister Anna (Kristen Bell) by her side and still courting lovable everyman Kristoff (Jonathan Groff). Everything seems fine and frolic-y until Elsa starts hearing a mysterious siren call coming from the nearby woods, which have remain unexplored for decades due to narrative convenience. This leads the sisters, Kristoff and their crew of comic-relief things-that-shouldn’t-emote-but-do – including reindeer Sven and snowman Olaf, the latter of whom is again voiced by Josh Gad and whose tenor acts as a Pavlovian prompt for parents to discreetly insert their AirPods – on a journey to uncover the origin of Elsa’s magic, and the dark history of Arendelle.
There’s a challenging chestnut of an idea resting inside the main story line, pivoting on Lee and Buck’s desire to explore postcolonial politics and the erasure of Indigenous culture. Arendelle, you see, has only thrived because Elsa and Anna’s grandfather (spoiler-alert, for those who don’t know how screenplays work) betrayed the trust of the area’s Indigenous people. But the filmmakers’ potentially interesting thematic interests are slathered in slow, prosaic storytelling. Not to mention an eventual undermining of whatever good cultural intentions Frozen 2 had, given that the film is obviously more interested in ensuring Elsa, Anna and the other modern-day Arendellians come out of the mess guilt-free than anything involving, say, actual accountability. None of this should be surprising – this is reconciliation by way of Disney, sanded down and squeaky clean. What actually takes the wind out of Frozen 2?s many attempts at epic gust is its repeated failure to imagine and entertain.
Elsa, Anna and the rest of Arendelle’s heroes don’t seem to have evolved much from the final minutes of the first film. The animation has been upgraded on a technical level – again, so much pretty water – but the “enchanted forest” near Arendelle feels conjured by any school-aged child with a half-decent imagination. Returning composers Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez attempt mightily to leap over the musical highs of Let it Go, but the necessary majesty just isn’t there in the obvious new contenders Into the Unknown and Show Yourself. And if anyone thought that the 2017 short film Olaf’s Frozen Adventure pointed to an overexposure of that particular character, then Frozen 2?s many snowman-centric moments will make you pray for global warming.
So Frozen 2 mostly ends up as a cash-grab. But thanks to its brand legacy and the sheer might of Disney, you’ll likely be handing that cash over regardless. Make it hard. And cold."
HAG_Doc9_Frozen2,"Once upon a time, Disney sent its subpar sequels to the kingdom of Straight-to-Video — a magical land filled with such titles as “The Return of Jafar,” “Cinderella II: Dreams Come True” and “The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea.” It was a happier time, one that is now apparently over, as “Frozen II” hits theaters.
That’s slightly unfair. The sequel to the 2013 animated blockbuster is much better than, say, “Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World.”
But “Frozen II” is still a disappointing continuation of the story of Queen Elsa and Princess Anna of Arendelle. It’s been a few years since Elsa (voice of Idina Menzel) learned to embrace her icy powers and settled on her throne. Little sister Anna (Kristen Bell) is still with hunky lunk Kristoff (Jonathan Groff). And may I say that it is nice to see a Disney princess in a long-term, stable relationship that suggests a real happy-ever-after? Living snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) continues to hang around, though now he has a fixation on the temporary nature of existence, really. Otherwise, things are going well in the charmingly Nordic kingdom, right up until Elsa begins hearing a lone voice singing from afar. Not long after the song begins — although only Elsa can hear it — the people of Arendelle experience some oddities, culminating in an earthquake that sends the entire population heading for the hills.
Elsa, Anna, Olaf and Kristoff, along with his reindeer buddy Sven, travel even further into the mountains, eventually coming upon an impenetrable mist — impenetrable, that is, until Elsa touches it. Beyond the veil they find two groups who have been trapped, and at one another’s throats, for 30 years: the first being several soldiers from Arendelle, and the second an Inuit-like tribe of magic-embracing people called the Northuldra.
To solve the problem of the mist — and the misunderstanding that has led to the decades-long cold war — Elsa decides to set out alone to find a river, once presumed mythical, that she hopes will have the answers to these mysteries, as well as the question of from where her powers come. Anna wants to go with her for protection. But sometimes an Ice Queen has to work alone.
“Frozen II” starts off on shaky ground, largely because it backtracks on much of the character development Anna and Elsa went though in the first movie. At the end of “Frozen,” Elsa had learned that her powers were a gift, not a burden, and she had become confident and proud in using them. At the beginning of “Frozen II,” that confidence is gone. She has an air of timidity that doesn’t make sense, given how we last saw her. Anna, whose loneliness in the first film led her to pursue a misguided romance that nearly left her dead, seems to have settled into life with family — complete with regular Friday night games of charades. But her focus on saving Elsa from danger now seems to come from a place of desperation, rather than love.
Whatever technical advancements have been made in computer animation over the past six years aren’t readily apparent in “Frozen II,” which mostly has the same frosty look as the first film. An impressive sea battle between Elsa and a glowing ice horse — just go with it — is as good as the visuals get. There are also several moments where the action takes place against a completely black background, presumably to better set off Elsa’s icy creations. But it’s a jarring change of scenery that doesn’t deliver any sort of visual or emotional payoff.
The biggest disappointment? The music. In “Frozen,” even the throwaway songs had wit. And the lyrics of that inescapable earworm “Let It Go” are actually deeply layered — a fact that is sometimes overlooked, in the face of the song’s ubiquity. Both Bell and Menzel bring impressive vocal skills, and Groff, a Broadway star who only got to sing a few lines in the first film, gets his moment in the spotlight with the hilarious, ’80s-inspired “Lost in the Woods.” But there isn’t really a standout song in the bunch. Returning composers Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez try to give Elsa two showstopping numbers: “Into the Unknown” and “Show Yourself.” But neither song reaches any emotional heights. (Never mind that there really isn’t a show to stop.)
Yes, “Frozen II” is a letdown when compared with the original. But it’s also a lackluster disappointment on its own — a pale shadow of what it could have been. It’s hard to see how the same team who made something so cool in 2013 could deliver something so — there’s no other word for it — lukewarm."
HAG_Doc10_Frozen2,"Elsa does not get a girlfriend in Frozen II, with condolences to the fans who pleaded to Disney for one, like supplicants petitioning an indifferent corporate god. The frosty former princess does, however, get a magical horse, and it’s pretty sick. It is, technically, a water spirit called a Nokk, but what matters is that it’s crystalline and capable of galloping across the surface of the ocean in a way that both looks cool and makes Elsa’s silver hair, unleashed from its braid, flutter aspirationally in the wind. That’s the kind of sight that you can imagine making a child’s heart explode with covetous delight, especially one of the little girls who were key to making the first Frozen a beast of a $1.27 billion global hit in 2013, and who pushed its breakout ballad “Let It Go” into brain-melting inescapability.
Frozen II is, like its predecessor, a kids’ movie, but it’s also, like its predecessor, an official Walt Disney Animation Studios release, which means it’s a vector for merchandise, music, theme-park rides, eventual remakes, and a young generation’s pop cultural pressure points. There is every possibility that “Into the Unknown” — the new designated banger from songwriting team Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, featuring the same sort of soaring chorus and the same high note as Let It Go — will become aural wallpaper in the houses and vehicles of families around the world. The tendency people have developed to talk about these movies as bearing a public responsibility is both a symptom of our disturbingly parasocial relationship with a massive media conglomerate, and an acknowledgment of that massive media conglomerate’s awesome reach and influence. Disney doles out its milestones of representation in intensely calculated dribs and drabs. It’ll only give one of its princesses more than an “exclusively gay moment” once its sure it can maximize plaudits for its progressiveness while preserving its bottom line in more repressive international regions.
It’s easier to think about Frozen II as a product than as a film because a (sometimes stunning-looking) product is all that it feels like. It was directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, the team behind the first film, from a script that Lee wrote, and that never really pretends that it exists because the story, rather than the market, demanded more. That story has the feel of the kind of invented errand that used to fuel countless direct-to-video sequels, only this one’s been blown up to a grand scale, with accompanying sumptuous production values. Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) is now queen of the hygge-heavy kingdom of Arendelle, though she’s distracted by a haunting call that only she can seem to hear. Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), still accompanied by his reindeer, Sven, is working his way up to proposing to Elsa’s sister, Anna (Kristen Bell). Then there’s the snowman. There is, I regret to inform you, an awful lot of the snowman, Olaf (Josh Gad), which, alongside Elsa’s ascendance to lead, indicates that some fan demands were heeded.
The group hauls off to the north in order to save Arendelle from a plot device, finding their way to an enchanted forest that’s home to the Sámi-inspired Northuldra tribe. The Northuldra, led by Yelana (Martha Plimpton), have a fraught history with Arendelle, once approached as allies until something went wrong and the area was sealed off by mist. The mystery behind these events will turn out to involve the colonialist ambitions of a past king and a betrayal that reveals that illustrious ancestors are rarely all they’re idealized to be — ambitious stuff from the company that made Pocahontas, though the inevitable happy resolution suggests that these films still aren’t exactly up to reckoning with restitutions for inherited trauma. That mystery, anyway, becomes intertwined with a journey of self-discovery involving an explanation for Elsa’s powers, and while that resolves in a sequence that I’m still not entirely sure I understand, it does manage to once again gift the character with a gleaming new outfit.
It’s hard not to feel jaded about Frozen II, while also understanding that those feelings don’t matter at all, and that the film is going to go on to draw huge audiences heavy on children and accompanying parents who’ll appreciate being thrown a bone by way of Kristoff’s amusingly ’80s-rock-inflected number. The film comes from a tradition that has spawned both incredible classics of animated artistry and overtly calculating entertainments, and it happens to skew more toward the latter. It’s carefully modulated to reach the widest possible audience while offering just enough for the adults in the room to shrug and think, Hey, at least these are strong female characters, right? And the thing is that, even as a mostly mercenary endeavor, the movie is still capable of moments of astonishing beauty. Take, for instance, the sequence in which Elsa attempts to cross a stormy sea, trying and failing to use ice to crest the raging waves. It’s in those waters that she battles the Nokk, eventually finding a way to get on its back and ride away triumphant. Adult me knows that thing is already available in toy stores, but child me would have died to have one."
